Your birth, while unmiraculuos, has brought you into an extraordinary time. The time of Heroes is passed and an evil grips the land. Beasts of hunger and rage have left the people weak and afraid. This is not a time of joy or prosperity but the beginning of a fading world. In this time of your birth one man is known to have brought this fate upon us all. A Chained Man... Stories speak of timeslong lost where the world faced such terrors and in those times a Hero rose from the gloom to save the world. It is in with your birth that this world regains some faint hope for perhaps it is you that will bring about the return of the Heroes...
It is in this time that you come to to us, and I, Baydun, depart. I've not left you alone however. You shall have Faith and my memories to guide you. now go, and seek your destiny...
